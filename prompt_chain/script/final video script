👋 INTRODUCTION (0:08–0:30)

Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, I help beginners start their fitness journey the simplest way possible — with routines you can do at home, without worrying about gym memberships or fancy workouts.

Today’s video is all about 5 beginner-friendly exercises that will help you get stronger, slimmer, and more confident. Whether your goal is weight loss, better stamina, or just feeling healthier, this 10–12 minute routine is the perfect place to start.

You can do this routine daily or 3–4 times a week, and trust me — if you stay consistent, you’re going to see and feel real results within weeks.

Alright, let’s jump right in!

🏋️‍♂️ EXERCISE 1: MARCHING IN PLACE (Warm-Up)
Duration: 30–45 seconds

This is the perfect warm-up exercise for complete beginners. It gets your heart rate up gently, loosens your joints, and wakes up your muscles without putting stress on your body.

How to Do It:

Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart. Keep your shoulders relaxed.

Tighten your core slightly — not too hard, just enough to stay stable.

Start lifting one knee at a time, just like you’re marching.

Swing your arms naturally by your sides.

Keep your back straight and your movements controlled.

Breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Tips:

Lift your knees only as high as is comfortable.

If you get tired, slow down the pace.

Focus on warming up, not rushing.

This is simple, but trust me — after 30 seconds, you’ll already feel your body waking up.

🏋️‍♂️ EXERCISE 2: BODYWEIGHT SQUATS
Reps: 10–15

Squats are one of the best full-body exercises you can do. They strengthen your legs, glutes, and core, and they improve your daily movement patterns like sitting, standing, and climbing stairs.

How to Do It:

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.

Keep your chest up and look forward.

Push your hips back as if you’re sitting into a chair.

Bend your knees and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor — or as low as you can comfortably go.

Keep your knees aligned with your toes; don’t let them cave inward.

Press through your heels and stand back up while squeezing your glutes.

Maintain a steady rhythm, no bouncing or rushing.

Tips:

If you're nervous about balance, place a sturdy chair behind you and lightly tap it with your hips before standing back up.

Keep your back straight — no rounding.

Go slow and controlled; quality matters more than depth.

Squats are foundational. Even if you can’t go very low now, keep practicing. You’ll get better every week.

🏋️‍♂️ EXERCISE 3: INCLINE PUSH-UPS (Wall or Table)
Reps: 8–12

Push-ups can be scary for beginners, especially if you can’t do a full one on the floor. That’s why incline push-ups are so perfect. They work your chest, shoulders, arms, and core — but in a safe, easy way.

How to Do It:

Stand in front of a wall or table.

Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the surface.

Step your feet back until your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels.

Tighten your core and keep your back flat — no arching.

Slowly bend your elbows and bring your chest toward the surface.

Go as close as you comfortably can, then push back up.

Keep your movements controlled, and breathe with each rep.

Tips:

If wall push-ups feel too easy, use a table or countertop.

If they feel hard, stand closer to the wall.

Keep your elbows at about a 45° angle — not too wide.

These build upper body strength fast. Do them consistently and you’ll be able to do real push-ups sooner than you think.

🏋️‍♂️ EXERCISE 4: STANDING KNEE RAISES
Reps: 12–15 each leg

This is a beginner-friendly core exercise that also improves balance and strengthens your lower abs — without needing to lie on the floor.

How to Do It:

Stand straight with your feet hip-width apart.

Tighten your core — imagine pulling your belly toward your spine.

Lift your right knee toward your chest at a comfortable height.

Lower it slowly.

Switch to your left knee and repeat.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, not fast or jerky.

Maintain a tall posture — chest up, shoulders relaxed.

Tips:

Hold onto a wall or chair if you struggle with balance.

Don’t lean backward when lifting your knee.

Exhale when your knee comes up, inhale when lowering.

This exercise looks simple, but when done correctly, it makes your core work hard — especially if you focus on balance and control.

🏋️‍♂️ EXERCISE 5: PLANK HOLD (Beginner-Friendly, Knees Down Option)
Duration: 10–20 seconds

Planks are one of the best exercises for building core strength, improving posture, and reducing lower back pain. And beginners can make it easier by dropping to the knees.

How to Do It:

Get down on the floor and place your elbows directly under your shoulders.

You can keep your knees on the ground (beginner) or extend your legs (advanced).

Keep your back straight — don’t let your hips sag or lift too high.

Tighten your core like you’re bracing for a punch.

Look down at the floor to keep your neck neutral.

Hold the position while breathing steadily.

Tips:

Start with 10 seconds and increase by 5 seconds each week.

Don’t hold your breath — keep it slow and steady.

If your lower back hurts, stop and reset your form.

Even a 10-second plank, done properly, builds core strength quickly.

💡 EXTRA TIPS FOR BEGINNERS (0:25–0:40)
1. Focus on form, not speed.

If you feel like rushing or doing more reps quickly — slow down. The real results come from doing movements correctly.

2. Track your progress.

Write down your reps, time, or how you felt after each workout. Seeing progress keeps you motivated.

3. Stay consistent.

Even doing this routine three times a week will make a huge difference. Show up — that’s the hardest part.

4. Don’t chase perfection.

Your squats don’t have to be super deep. Your plank doesn’t have to be long. Start where you are.

5. Celebrate small wins.

If today you did 10 seconds more, or one extra rep — that’s progress. Be proud of it.

6. Drink water and stretch.

Staying hydrated and doing a quick stretch afterward helps with recovery and prevents soreness.
